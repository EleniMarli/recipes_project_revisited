  instructions: "1. Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper according to your taste preferences.\n2. Beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined.\n3. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt and coat the bottom of the skillet.\n4. Once the butter is melted and the skillet is heated, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet.\n5. Let the eggs cook for a few seconds until the edges start to set.\n6. Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges towards the center of the skillet, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.\n7. Continue to cook and gently stir the eggs until they are mostly set but still slightly runny.\n8. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the residual heat finish cooking the eggs. Be careful not to overcook them.\n9. If desired, sprinkle chopped chives or grated cheese over the scrambled eggs for extra flavor.\n10. Serve the scrambled eggs hot with toast, bacon, or your favorite breakfast sides.",
